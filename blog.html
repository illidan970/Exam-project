        <h3>Hotel Blogging: Everything You Need to Know</h3>
        <p> At one point, it was enough to be small in order to qualify as a boutique hotel, but now you should stand out with personal touches that genuinely feel like they were chosen by an individual and not by a committee. Telling your potential customers about all the things that make you different from the commoditized, you-know-what-to-expect experience of the monolithic chains depends on expressing your messages with a voice and using content that gets that message across. Hotel blogging is an excellent way for boutique hotels to take advantage of a medium that offers the ability to expand deeply on topics and attract like-minded readers who, given some help, could become advocates for your hotel’s brand.</p>
        
        <h4>In this post, I’ll explain:</h4>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Who you should have in mind when writing posts;</li>
        <li>The nuts-and-bolts of making blog posts happen;</li>
        <li>How to keep your eye on making sales even when blogging; and finally</li>
        <li>What the keys to excellence are for hotel blogging and how you can measure whether you’re hitting these targets.</li>

      <h3>How Do Hotel Blog Posts Get Written?</h3>
        <p>The “who” of writing is often the decision to make before settling on the “what”.</p>
        
        <p> Marketing managers can be the perfect specialist for guiding a series of evergreen posts that do the jobs many guests will ask of content. This is also a great time to establish a tone that will bind all of your posts together.<p>
                
        <p> If you have specific expectations for a series of blog posts and want all of the elements — writing, photos, graphics, and technical details like search engine optimization — to be at a very high level it’s probably time to call on professional content creators. With specialized experience in hotel content marketing, and a team of professionals with a variety of skills, we can often hit your goals more efficiently than an in-house team member would.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The amount of traffic your posts get from search engines</li>
            <li>How easy they are to read and scan for specific information</li>
            <li>The likelihood that readers will be inspired to share your posts with their networks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Use a Hierarchy to Organize Information</h2>
        
        <p>Both human readers and the computers that drive search-engine results depend on certain signals to make it easier to read the information a blog post presents. It’s helpful to use:</p>
